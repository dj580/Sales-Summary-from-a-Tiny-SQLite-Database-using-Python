# Basic Sales Summary with SQLite, Python, and Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to work with an **SQLite database** in Python to extract and visualize basic sales information.  
It covers the complete workflow from **database creation** to **SQL querying** and **data visualization**.

The task involves:
- Creating a small SQLite database (`sales_data.db`)
- Adding sample sales data (15 rows)
- Running SQL queries to calculate:
  - Total quantity sold per product
  - Total revenue per product
- Displaying the results in the console
- Creating and saving a simple bar chart of revenue by product

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **sqlite3** (built into Python â€” no installation needed)
- **pandas** (for running SQL queries and handling data)
- **matplotlib** (for plotting bar chart)
